# Demo

This is a basic repository I've created to learn how to use github.

This text was edited into the README after creation.

More text made in VS Code post clone.

When adding files to a project with git, need to use the "git add" command.
Will often see people typing: "git add ." This tells git to track all the files listed here, both untracked and modified files.
Note: Untracked means it's a new file that git doesn't recognize.
Alternatively, you can do "git add 'individual file name'" to add the individual files/folders by name you want it to track.

git status shows you the changes made to the git repo that are being tracked.
If all changes are being tracked and there's nothing showing untracked, then you can commit your changes to the repo.
Use "git commit -m "Insert message here."" to commit.
-Note -m is for message, as you need to have a message in order to commit your files.
-Generally the message should have something to do with the what and why behind the commit you're making.

With git commits, you can have 2 -m's in the commit line, the first -m is the commit "title", the second -m is the description.
